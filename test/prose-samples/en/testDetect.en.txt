A Johannine expression (Jn 10.17–18; see 2 Nephi 2.8n), here combined with <i>loved the world</i> (Jn 3.16) and <i>draw all men unto him</i> (Jn 12.32; see 3 Ne 27.14n). The first two expressions are paired again at Ether 12.33.

Narration.js:761 God does not say this yet, but he will later; see Mt 7.23 (3 Ne 14.23); 2 Nephi 25.41; Lk 13.27. Nephi transforms God’s general summons at Isa 55.1 into a personal invitation to come to Christ (see 1 Ne 8.15–18n), in the process replacing Isaiah’s “wine and milk” with <i>milk and honey</i>, a common OT description of the bounties of the promised land (note that Jacob had earlier quoted Isa 55.1–2 at 2 Ne 9.50–51).
Narration.js:761 <i>“All ye ends of the earth”</i> is a non-biblical phrase that occurs eight times in the BoM, nearly always in invitations to repent or come to Christ. It is indicative of the Nephite writers’ awareness of the global scope of their message (but see also Isa 45.22;Morm 3.18;Moro 10.24for prophets addressing “all <i>“the”</i> ends of the earth”).

“A Marvelous Work and a Wonder” • (Isa. 11:11; 29:14; refer in this text to 2 Ne. 21:10–12 & 2 Ne. 27:26)
2 Ne. 21:10–12 The Gathering of Israel (Isaiah 11.10–16) And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek; and his rest shall be glorious. And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
“will proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder” • Isa 11.11; cited at 2 Ne 21.11; 29.1
The combination of lost and fallen state with Messiah and six hundred years echoes Lehi’s prophecy at 1 Ne 10.4–6.
The marvelous work that God will do in bringing forth his words refers to the coming forth of the BoM, which is intended to convince both Jews and Gentiles to believe in Christ (BoM title page).
Being judged by God’s words (personified here) also appears at Jn 12.48; cf. 2 Ne 29.11.
