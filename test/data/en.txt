Thank you for sharing your word thoughts, Lyndon. It’s fascinating to explore the deeper meaning of words and their potential impact on our understanding of scripture. In 3 Nephi 16:4-5, the phrase “fulness of the Gentiles” is indeed significant. It refers to the time when the Gentiles, or nations, will receive the gospel of Jesus Christ and have the opportunity to come unto Him. This concept is further supported by other scriptures, such as 3 Nephi 21:6, which speaks of the Father showing forth His power to the Gentiles and inviting them to repent and be baptized. Additionally, 3 Nephi 5:25 and 3 Nephi 20:13 mention the gathering of scattered remnants and the restoring of the house of Jacob, which includes both the Israelites and the Gentiles who have embraced the gospel. The translation process was guided by the Spirit, ensuring that the essential teachings and principles are conveyed accurately. Whether we use the word “multitude” or “fullness” to describe the Gentiles, the central message remains the same – that all people, regardless of their lineage, have the opportunity to come unto Christ and be partakers of His blessings. In summary, the phrase “fulness of the Gentiles” in 3 Nephi 16:4-5 signifies the time when the Gentiles will have the chance to receive the gospel and be gathered in. It aligns with other scriptures that speak of the gathering of scattered remnants and the restoration of the house of Jacob.
It talks about the consequences of the fall of Adam and Eve. Before the fall, if they had not partaken of the forbidden fruit, they would have remained in a state of innocence and ignorance, without experiencing the joy and blessings that come from knowing good and evil (II Nephi 2:23). However, Heavenly Father, in His wisdom, allowed Adam to fall so that mankind could be created and experience the fullness of joy (2 Nephi 2:25). This passage is connected to other scriptures such as Genesis 3:16 and Moses 5:11, which further explain the consequences of the fall. In Genesis 3:16, Eve is told that because of the fall, she will experience sorrow in childbirth, indicating that the ability to have children is a result of the fall. In Moses 5:11, Eve expresses her gratitude for the fall, recognizing that without it, she and Adam would not have had children or known the joy of redemption. Understanding this passage helps us comprehend the purpose of life and the role of the fall in enabling us to experience joy and progression.
See John3:16 and, but not First John 1:9 for the same concept of the fall and the atonement.
The fruit mentioned in 1 Nephi 8:9-12 represents something desirable and joyous. It is described as being sweet and white, surpassing any other fruit in its goodness and purity. In the book of Genesis, there is mention of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 2:9, 3:6). These trees represent different choices and paths that humans can take. The fruit in Lehi’s dream could be seen as a representation of the blessings and joy that come from choosing the path of righteousness and partaking of the goodness of God. In the book of Revelation, there are references to the tree of life as well (Revelation 2:7, 22:2). This tree is associated with eternal life and the blessings of God. So, the fruit in Lehi’s dream may also symbolize the blessings of eternal life and joy that come from following the teachings of Jesus Christ.
In accordance with David’s last words at 2 Sam 23.3 (cf. Mos 23.8; 29.16). The Davidic reference may have been included as a conciliatory gesture to his descendants among the Mulekites. The reading in P (“thereby”) implies that keeping the commandments leads to rejoicing and love.
As Jacob’s priestly lineage comes to an end, the transferal of the plates to Benjamin means that both the Large and Small Plates of Nephi are in the possession of the Nephite kings; cf. WoM 1.10. Amaleki’s reference to spiritual gifts and his assertion about the sources of good and evil will be repeated at Moro 7.12, 16–17; 10.13–16; cf. Alma 5.40. The order of gifts listed generally reflects 1 Cor 12.10.
Consistently D&C 3:16-17 no "Samites"  Mormon 1:8 mentioned across the board in Restoration scripture; cf. Jacob 1:13; 4 Nephi 1:38; Mormon 1:8; D&C 3:17-18
The Nephites thought of themselves as living on an island, and they believed that other groups of Israelites had been led away by God to other islands as well; see 1 Ne 19.10,15–16;21.1,8;22.3–4;2 Ne 10.7–8;29.7. Note also the mention of “isles” in Isa 51.5, which Jacob quoted at 2 Ne 8.5.
There is a difference between being reconciled to the will of God (accepting the contingencies of salvation history, even as they may apply negatively to one’s posterity), unique here, and being reconciled unto God (repenting of personal sins in accordance with the plan of salvation), which occurs three times in the NT and four times in the BoM. In the NT, God always reconciles humans to himself through Christ; the BoM, by contrast, invites people to reconcile themselves to God, by availing themselves of Christ’s atonement; cf. 2 Nephi 33.9; Jacob 4.11. Nevertheless, even if salvation requires an element of human volition, the process is initiated and completed through the grace of God; see 2 Nephi 25.23n.
See Deut 30.19; Jacob2 draws on Lehi1’s elaboration at 2 Ne 2.26–29 as well as on Jeremiah’s allusion at Jer 21.8.
In 2 Nephi 9:13 it says, "O how great the plan of our God!" Hugh Nibley notes that the word "plan" is not found in the Bible, yet it's found forty-two times in the Book of Mormon . . . and thirty-six times in the book of Alma. . . . Origen tells us that in the early church they taught that you earned your position here before you came here. So whatever happened to the plan? How did it drop out of the Bible? . . . When the temple was lost the rabbis took over. They were learned men but they were not priests. . . . The philosophers at the School of Alexandria took it over, and in their place you have the doctrines of St. Augustine--this takes the place of the plan. That is, you are predestined to damnation or you are predestined to salvation. . . . This predestination doctrine of St. Augustine was taken over by the Lutherans and by the Calvinists especially. What happens to you is because you were predestined that way. Of course, you didn't live before you came here; you didn't earn it or anything like that. . . . All creation had to be instantaneously, simultaneously complete. Everything was completely there all at once, so you had no background or anything. [Hugh W. Nibley, Teachings of the Book of Mormon, pp. 295-296] [See the commentary on Jarom 1:2; Alma 22:13]

WB includes “hindrance, opposition,” though both Jacob and Nephi knew of Jesus’s future crucifixion; see 2 Nephi 6.9;1 Ne 11.33;19.10.

“to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life” • See Deut 30.19; Jacob2 draws on Lehi1’s elaboration at 2 Ne 2.26–29 as well as on Jeremiah’s allusion at Jer 21.8.

Jacob concludes by referencing the plan of salvation; see 2 Nephi 9.53–54n.

A synopsis of Lehi’s words at 2 Nephi 2.26–29, which were an elaboration of Deut 30.19. Here, however, the expression is conflated with Jeremiah’s interpretation of the same Deut verse at Jer 21.8: “I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.”

“Everlasting death” • Here and in 2 Nephi 10:23, can be contrasted with the temporary death that everyone will experience and then be rescued from by the Resurrection. Elsewhere the BoM uses the term “second death” to describe the post-resurrection, post-judgment separation from God that will never end (e.g., Alma 12.32: “a second death, which was an everlasting death”).
The combination of repentance, baptism, faith, and enduring to the end (along with the Holy Ghost) is identified as the doctrine of Christ at 2 Nephi 31.2–21, and the essence of the gospel at 3 Ne 27.13–22. Although Jacob in these two verses, and later Nephi (in ch. 31), speaks in general, abstract terms about baptism, there are no recorded baptisms in the BoM until Alma baptizes at Mos 18, nearly four hundred years later, where the practice appears to be something new.
