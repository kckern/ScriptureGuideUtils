Peter testified that Christ was the “lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world” (1 Peter 1:19-20). In the words of John the Revelator, Christ was the “Lamb slain from the foundation of the world” (Revelation 13:8). Such expressions affirm that the plan of salvation was known and taught even before the creation of the earth (see D&C 132:8-11).

Note* Richardson, Richardson and Bentley note that more examples of circular repetitive parallelism are found in Mosiah 3:25-26; 11:21; Alma 3:15-16; 14:29; 24:7-10; 60:20; 62:41; Helaman 11:10-16; and Mormon 7:2-5.
