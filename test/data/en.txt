Thank you for sharing your word thoughts, Lyndon. It’s fascinating to explore the deeper meaning of words and their potential impact on our understanding of scripture. In 3 Nephi 16:4-5, the phrase “fulness of the Gentiles” is indeed significant. It refers to the time when the Gentiles, or nations, will receive the gospel of Jesus Christ and have the opportunity to come unto Him. This concept is further supported by other scriptures, such as 3 Nephi 21:6, which speaks of the Father showing forth His power to the Gentiles and inviting them to repent and be baptized. Additionally, 3 Nephi 5:25 and 3 Nephi 20:13 mention the gathering of scattered remnants and the restoring of the house of Jacob, which includes both the Israelites and the Gentiles who have embraced the gospel. The translation process was guided by the Spirit, ensuring that the essential teachings and principles are conveyed accurately. Whether we use the word “multitude” or “fullness” to describe the Gentiles, the central message remains the same – that all people, regardless of their lineage, have the opportunity to come unto Christ and be partakers of His blessings. In summary, the phrase “fulness of the Gentiles” in 3 Nephi 16:4-5 signifies the time when the Gentiles will have the chance to receive the gospel and be gathered in. It aligns with other scriptures that speak of the gathering of scattered remnants and the restoration of the house of Jacob.
It talks about the consequences of the fall of Adam and Eve. Before the fall, if they had not partaken of the forbidden fruit, they would have remained in a state of innocence and ignorance, without experiencing the joy and blessings that come from knowing good and evil (II Nephi 2:23). However, Heavenly Father, in His wisdom, allowed Adam to fall so that mankind could be created and experience the fullness of joy (2 Nephi 2:25). This passage is connected to other scriptures such as Genesis 3:16 and Moses 5:11, which further explain the consequences of the fall. In Genesis 3:16, Eve is told that because of the fall, she will experience sorrow in childbirth, indicating that the ability to have children is a result of the fall. In Moses 5:11, Eve expresses her gratitude for the fall, recognizing that without it, she and Adam would not have had children or known the joy of redemption. Understanding this passage helps us comprehend the purpose of life and the role of the fall in enabling us to experience joy and progression.
See John3:16 and, but not First John 1:9 for the same concept of the fall and the atonement.
The fruit mentioned in 1 Nephi 8:9-12 represents something desirable and joyous. It is described as being sweet and white, surpassing any other fruit in its goodness and purity. In the book of Genesis, there is mention of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 2:9, 3:6). These trees represent different choices and paths that humans can take. The fruit in Lehi’s dream could be seen as a representation of the blessings and joy that come from choosing the path of righteousness and partaking of the goodness of God. In the book of Revelation, there are references to the tree of life as well (Revelation 2:7, 22:2). This tree is associated with eternal life and the blessings of God. So, the fruit in Lehi’s dream may also symbolize the blessings of eternal life and joy that come from following the teachings of Jesus Christ.
