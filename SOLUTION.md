# Clean Solution Summary

## Problem Solved
Your customer was getting `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` errors because the CommonJS build was trying to require ES modules from the `./data/` directory.

## Simple Solution Implemented

### 1. Single Build Script
- Created `embed-data.cjs` that embeds all data directly into `scriptures.mjs`
- No more separate data files to maintain
- No filesystem dependencies - works in browsers!

### 2. Clean File Structure
- `scriptures.mjs` - ES module with embedded data (works everywhere)
- `scriptures.cjs` - CommonJS build from the above
- `data/` - Source data files (for development only, not published)
- `embed-data.cjs` - Build script

### 3. Updated package.json
- Simplified build process: `npm run build`
- Only publishes the 3 essential files
- Proper dual module support via exports field

## What This Fixes
✅ **Browser compatibility** - No fs dependencies, works in all environments  
✅ **CommonJS compatibility** - No more ERR_REQUIRE_ESM errors  
✅ **ES module compatibility** - Still works perfectly  
✅ **Maintenance** - Only one source file to maintain  
✅ **Bundle size** - Smaller because no duplicate files  

## Build Process
1. `npm run embed` - Embeds data into scriptures.mjs (optional dev command)
2. `npm run build` - Embeds data + builds CommonJS version
3. `npm publish` - Automatically runs build first

## Result
- Your customer's error is completely fixed
- Library works in all environments (Node.js, browsers, bundlers)
- Much simpler to maintain
- No redundant files!
